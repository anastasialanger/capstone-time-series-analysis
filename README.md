# capstone-time-series-analysis
Capstone project on clustering and forecasting electricity demand time-series.
The data set from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2017 was used: Tao Hong, Jingrui Xie, and Jonathan Black, "Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2017: Hierarchical Probabilistic Load Forecasting," International Journal of Forecasting.
Jupyter notebooks include the exploratory data analysis, clustering of a subset of time-series and the implementation of models (k-NN, Random Forest, Neural Network with 2 hidden layers and Convolutional Network) to compute the forecasts.
